# Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

A future element I would like to add to the Coffee Shop is an interactive form where studnets or visitors can reserve a book for pick-up and add a drink to so they can pick up both book and beverage upon arrival at the Triple Peaks Library.
