1.  Implementing an interactive form - mobile / pick-up order can be placed ahead of time at the coffee shop.
2.  check-out screen
3.  credit-card authorization / processing
4.  Unique Identifier - This is a QR Code that is sent to the user via email along with their drink order. At the coffee shop, the user scans the QR Code and it tells the user to look for coffee cups with a certain number on it. For example. If you place a mobile order for 4 coffees, you will receive an email receipt with a QR Code and a list of your coffees below. Upon arrival at the shop, you scan your QR Code at a designated kiosk at the front of the shop. it will tell you "order processing" or "Order complete #14" This means all 4 of your coffee cups have the number 14 on them.
5.  Read & Refresh - Check-out a library book from Triple Peaks Librarry and receive a dicount on coffee. Complete 5 Read & refresh and receive a FREE coffee.
